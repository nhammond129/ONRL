# ONRL - _One Night RogueLike_

## Foreword

In the interest of providing Sunday an example of my gamedev work, I'm going to vomit up a quick and dirty roguelike. I'm going to use C++ and SFML, because I'm familiar with them.

Devlog will be fairly informal. I'll try to keep it up to date as I go.

I've got a window up and running.
I spent some time fiddling around with padding to get the gutter between the glyph grid uniform on all sides. Wasn't necessary, but it was annoying me >_>;

i made a map class. (and a homemade pizza. it was great.)
no actual map generation yet, just a random 2d array of tiles.
Spent a while reading about map gen stuff. I'll probably just do some bsp + some CA style annealing to "smoof" it out.

ðŸ‘€ Sorry I haven't pushed this up to github yet lol.

I actually won't be around this weekend, since on Friday I'm going up north to visit my mother, and I won't be back until Sunday night or mid-Monday. I know time is pressing, but it'll certainly be something "playable" before I go.

I slapped down some crusty code to get a player on the screen, so here's that.

Just arbitrarily dropping him at `5, 5` for now, and there's some basic collision checks.
